Coca-Cola AI vs. Disney Craft: The Language Signalling a Turning Point for AI Creativity

The Coca-Cola Company's new AI-generated Christmas ad has sparked attention, but not the kind brands hope for. Audience language shows a shift: people want to feel the work, the depth, and the human effort behind what they watch.

We analysed organic reactions to Coca-Cola’s AI ad and The Walt Disney Company's hand-crafted holiday storytelling. The contrast reveals what audiences connect with, and what they quietly reject.

Coca-Cola: Emotion Without Weight

No pride in tradition: Mentions of lost tradition appear repeatedly, signalling that audiences feel the brand has stepped away from the heritage they once trusted to anchor Christmas.

Turning people toward Pepsi: References to switching brands surface far more often than expected, showing that the ad isn’t neutral, it’s actively reshaping loyalty in small but noticeable ways.

Bad for the brain, nothing to latch onto: Viewers describe the ad as mentally “flat”, offering no emotional hook or narrative depth. Language suggests cognitive disengagement rather than curiosity or delight.

Spectacle without substance: Key comments frame it as visually impressive but emotionally empty, a kind of engineered magic that never quite lands.

Disney: Craft, Voice, and Earned Emotion

Magic that feels made, not generated: Mentions of “magic” appear consistently and organically, reflecting that audiences see the ad as crafted, intentional, and rooted in human storytelling.

Connection through voice: Viewers repeatedly highlight the narrator’s voice as an emotional anchor. It’s the human texture, not the visuals, that shapes the experience.

Respect for hard work: Comments show admiration for the craft. The time, skill, and effort put into every frame. This labour becomes part of the emotional payoff for the audience.

Depth people choose to invest in: Audience language reflects gratitude, the sense that someone cared enough to make something meaningful rather than generate something fast.

Wider Read: Craft vs. Convenience

Audience responses to Disney are grounded in respect and connection. People feel the care behind the work, and that care becomes part of the emotional value.

Coca-Cola’s AI ad, by contrast, triggers language around loss, of tradition, of story, of depth. Viewers feel the absence of human touch. Some even describe it as a small betrayal, a brand known for Christmas magic choosing the shortcut instead of the craft.

Together, they reflect a more and more apparent truth, audiences aren’t just reacting to ads, they’re signalling where AI creativity may be reaching its limit.

Why This Matters

People don’t dislike AI. They dislike feeling like the effort has been removed. Christmas is one of the few moments where audiences still expect emotional depth, craft, and care.

The reaction to Coca-Cola isn’t outrage, but that of indifference. And indifference is far more damaging. Disney earns connection through craftsmanship; Coca-Cola risks diluting theirs through convenience.

At Capodan, we decode audience language to reveal these emotional signals. Because language shows where people connect, where they disconnect, and where brands quietly lose the room.
