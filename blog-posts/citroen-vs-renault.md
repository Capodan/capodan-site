The EV conversation isn’t really about performance. It’s about practicality. When drivers discuss Citroën and Renault, their words show what’s truly shaping decisions: affordability, usability, and everyday trust.

We analysed organic audience language around both brands. The results reveal where each stands in the electric transition — and what’s holding people back.

Citroën: Counting the Cost of Change
💸 Salary first, sockets second Mentions of salary are over three times more common in Citroën discussions than in the general EV set. Buyers are linking affordability directly to income, asking whether electric ownership fits their pay packet rather than just their lifestyle.

🔌 Home charging becomes a financial hurdle Charging at home talk appears around 25 times more often in Citroën threads. The concern isn’t about range, it’s about the cost of setting up and running chargers. People describe installation as an added household bill, not a convenience upgrade.

🛢️ Oil still finds its way in Oil references, though unexpected, appear twice as often as in broader EV language. It signals confusion: some buyers are still thinking in ICE terms, surprised by maintenance details they thought they were leaving behind.

🚗 ICE comfort remains strong Mentions of ICE (petrol and diesel) are nearly twice as frequent, showing many still prefer what they already understand. “Familiar,” “easier,” and “simpler” are the most common adjectives tied to ICE talk, nostalgia as much as practicality.

Renault: Friction, Feedback, and Foreign Competition
⚙️ Gear confusion dominates usability talk Mentions of gear are four times more common for Renault, with repeated frustrations around gear selection indicators. Small interface issues are becoming dealbreakers when buyers already feel uncertain about EV control.

🇨🇳 China enters the chat References to Chinese EVs appear almost three times more often in Renault discussions than elsewhere. Consumers are no longer dismissing them as cheap imports, they’re now credible, modern alternatives sitting beside Renault in the same sentence.

🚘 Tesla remains the benchmark Tesla mentions are around twice as frequent when Renault is discussed, positioning it as the standard to beat. Drivers instinctively use Tesla language as shorthand for reliability and innovation.

🔊 The missing beep problem Requests for a louder reverse beep appear 1.5 times more often than any other sound-related feature. It reflects a deeper need for feedback and reassurance in electric driving, proof that people want signals they can trust.

Wider Read: Practicality vs. Proof
Citroën conversations revolve around affordability. People are weighing EV ownership like a financial decision, not a lifestyle choice. Renault’s discussions centre on trust and usability, where every beep or gear shift becomes a reflection of confidence in the product.

Together, they show two sides of the EV transition. One brand’s buyers ask “Can I afford it?” The other’s ask “Can I rely on it?”

Why This Matters
Language around Citroën is tied to cost and comfort, the emotional weight of paying for the future. Language around Renault is tied to function and proof, the need to feel technology is ready for them.

At Capodan, we decode these linguistic signals to uncover how audiences make sense of change. Because language reveals perception. Perception drives behaviour. And behaviour drives growth.
