A linguistic snapshot of how audiences describe what they collect, gift, and play with.

The plush world has long been dominated by the pristine perfection of **Jellycat**. Soft, premium, and gift-ready, they’ve become a default for birthdays, boyfriends, and mums alike. But a new challenger is creeping into the cultural space: **Labubu**.

Where Jellycat trade on polish, Labubu thrives on imperfection. It is jagged, mischievous, and unconventional, but precisely for that reason, it is striking a chord.

The question is not just about sales. It’s about language. How do people talk about these toys once the wrapping paper is gone? What emerges in conversation—collecting, gifting, playing—shows how meaning is made in the market.

We analyzed organic language from audiences around both brands. What we found shows more than preference. It shows how Labubu and Jellycat occupy different poles of the same plush universe.

<br>

🐇 **Labubu: Imperfection, Play, and Community**

- **Kids embrace the weird**: Children are **11.5x more likely** to love Labubu than Jellycat, despite initial parental hesitation. The unconventional is what makes it appealing.  
- **Play vs. collection tension**: Mentions of *“let kids play”* score **9x higher**, but collection is rising too, a dynamic that mirrors collector-style fandom.  
- **Swaps as social glue**: Swapping dominates comparison, showing Labubu has already sparked strong trading communities and grassroots desire.  
- **Inner child unlocked**: Adults lean into themes of nostalgia and reassurance (*“you’re not alone”*), showing the brand is bigger than kids’ play.  
- **Serenity leads**: Among character names, *Serenity* emerges as the most resonant, a softer counterbalance to Labubu’s jagged edge.

🍮 **Jellycat: Premium, Pristine, and Predictable**

- **Gifting dominates**: Mentions of birthdays are **17x more likely**, with boyfriends and even mums highlighted. Jellycat live in the premium gift space.  
- **Accessibility wins**: Online availability dominates comparison. People know where to get them, and *Selfridges* is the go-to.  
- **Dragons lead the pack**: The *Dragon* is the most sought-after, with *“finding”* specific types scoring **9x higher**—the hunt is part of the fun.  
- **Perfection questioned**: Stuffing issues surface (dominates comparison), with some saying they’re not plush enough.  
- **Tag debates persist**: Like Labubu, audiences argue over keeping or removing tags, but the tension here isn’t kids vs. adults, just collectors vs. casuals.

🔍 **Wider Read: Quirk vs. Polish**

Language shows that **Labubu** is carried by quirk. The thrill is in imperfection, swaps, and the blurred line between plaything and collectible. Its language builds community, not convention.  

**Jellycat**, by contrast, are carried by polish. They thrive as perfect gifts, premium presents, and plush status symbols. Their language is about certainty and consistency, not disruption.  

That distinction matters. One toy is framed as a unique subculture. The other as a polished standard.

💡 **Why This Matters**

The way audiences describe Labubu and Jellycat signals different strategic value.  

High-frequency mentions of *swaps*, *inner child*, and *Serenity* show Labubu is more than a plush. It’s a culture in the making.  

Mentions of *gifting*, *tags*, and *availability* show Jellycat are cemented as the pristine option—reliable, but edging toward predictability.  

For brands, the lesson is clear. Audiences don’t just buy objects. They buy the stories those objects let them tell about childhood, about gifting, about belonging.  

At Capodan, we decode these signals to show what people really mean, and why it matters for growth.  

Language reveals perception. Perception drives behavior. And behavior drives growth.  

If you’re curious what your audience is signaling about your brand or product, we’ll show you what’s being missed—and what to do about it.
