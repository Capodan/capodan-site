date: 2025-07-01
---

In our recent articles, we compared brands head-to-head. This time, we explored two key perspectives on the same product: what patients and healthcare professionals are saying about Omnipod, especially the new Omnipod 5 system.

Recent earnings reports show strong revenue growth driven by Omnipod adoption and expanded market access. This year, Insulet Corporation further extended Omnipod 5’s reach by integrating it with Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring. These developments underscore the importance of understanding how patients and healthcare professionals actually experience the product.

So what really matters to each group? And what does their language reveal about the hidden value Omnipod brings to their daily lives?

We analyzed thousands of words from both groups discussing their experiences managing diabetes with Omnipod to find out.

🔹 **Patients: Real Voices, Real Frustrations, Real Wins**

💉 **Tubing is an annoyance**: Many patients share frustration about tubing getting kinked or bent, leading to worry or discomfort throughout the day.

💉 **Removing for surgery causes anxiety**: Patients describe taking the pod off before surgery as more than an inconvenience — it’s a major source of anxiety that healthcare professionals rarely consider.

💉 **Morning insulin sensitivity is overlooked**: Users highlight a trend of increased insulin sensitivity in the morning. It’s a subtle but important pattern pointing to a need for better education and device adjustments.

💉 **Finally, a closed-loop system**: The launch of Omnipod 5 is celebrated. Patients are grateful for automated insulin adjustments and integration with Dexcom, which many say brings peace of mind.

💉 **Tegaderm patch tips spread peer-to-peer**: Patients recommend using 3M's Tegaderm patch under the pod to make removal easier and reduce irritation. This user-led advice highlights information gaps that manufacturers could address directly.

💉 **Desire for longer needles or better access**: Some patients express a wish for longer needle options, citing comfort or absorption challenges. They also describe difficulties obtaining needles that fit their needs.

💉 **Watch connectivity is a hit**: Linking Omnipod to a smartwatch earns consistent praise. Patients say it makes glucose management quicker and more discreet, fitting seamlessly into busy lives.

🩺 **Healthcare Professionals: Key Concerns from the Frontline**

🏥 **Premiums and patient stress**: Healthcare professionals believe one of the most important considerations for patients is the impact of high insurance premiums, which affect them both emotionally and financially.

🏥 **Deductibles, coinsurance, and affordability options**: Providers believe that the complexity of reversing claims, managing coinsurance, and navigating insurance hurdles is an important issue for patients.

🏥 **Trust issues with delegated staff**: Professionals highlight concerns about delegating diabetes care to certified nursing assistants (CNAs). They emphasize their need to ensure only licensed professionals manage insulin administration, describing trust challenges around blood sugar checks versus full diabetes management.

🏥 **Fertility and menstrual cycle conversations**: Providers stress the importance of discussing fertility, hormonal cycles, and lifestyle factors with patients. Managing diabetes well includes understanding how it intersects with reproductive health.

🔎 **Why Does This Matter?**

Research consistently suggests that listening to all stakeholders can improve outcomes in healthcare settings. Reports from *The Beryl Institute* emphasize that organizations prioritizing patient experience often see improvements in both patient satisfaction and staff engagement.

Our analysis of real conversations reveals that patients and healthcare professionals don’t always align. Patients care about day-to-day realities like anxiety over surgery prep, convenience, and small tips that improve comfort. Healthcare professionals believe it’s all about affordability challenges and ensuring proper licensing in care delivery.

This disconnect can breed frustration. But it also creates opportunity: by listening to both groups, medtech companies can close expectation gaps and deliver products and support that truly work for everyone involved.

🧠 **What We Learned**

When you really listen, you uncover details standard surveys may miss. The words people use — their concerns, gratitude, or practical hacks — show where products delight or fall short.

As Omnipod’s success shows, brands that hear and act on these insights build trust and loyalty. They don’t just sell devices; they empower lives.

We discovered much more in our full analysis, but this is a glimpse of what’s possible when you unlock the real voices of your most important audiences.
