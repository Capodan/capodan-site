title: "Dyson Has the Name. But SharkNinja Has the Game."

A linguistic insight into how two of the biggest hair tools are landing with real users.

We analysed hundreds of customer reviews from a leading online retailer. Not for star ratings. For language. What are people actually saying about the Dyson Airwrap vs the SharkNinja FlexStyle? Which words appear? What tone is used? What patterns crop up again and again?

This is where product sentiment lives, and what we found paints a sharp and telling picture.

<br>

🔹 **Dyson Airwrap: Premium... with Friction**  
🟣 **Not built to last (the curls, that is)**: Time and again, users talked about curls that "drop in a couple of minutes" or "fall out before I leave the house." It’s not a dealbreaker for everyone, but it’s enough of a trend to signal a mismatch between price tag and performance.

🟣 **App is appreciated**: Users who explored the companion app praised its simplicity and the ability to remember routines, a small but meaningful plus that made the experience feel polished and personalised.

🟣 **"Easy to use" but still dividing opinion**: Several reviews complimented setup and usability, especially for straight or slightly wavy hair. But the sentiment wasn’t universal. Those with thicker or curlier hair often felt underwhelmed by results.

🟣 **Premium label, premium expectation**: There’s an undercurrent of expectation in Dyson reviews. Users want to be wowed, and if they aren’t, the disappointment is louder. That gap between brand promise and user reality creates tension.

🔹 **Shark FlexStyle: A Challenger with Confidence**  
🟣 **Glossy, healthy, happy hair**: Words like “glossy”, “healthy”, and “so smooth” came up frequently. The emotional tone here is warm, proud, and satisfied. Users didn’t just like the results, they felt good about them.

🟣 **Noisy but worth it**: Multiple reviewers noted that the FlexStyle is “a bit louder” and “heavier,” but the trade-off is rarely framed as a problem. The phrase “worth it” appears more than once; weight and noise seem accepted in exchange for impact.

🟣 **Styling meets drying, and that’s valued**: The combo of function styling and drying landed well with busy users. People spoke about cutting routine time, skipping salon trips, and getting better results from home.

🟣 **Reinforcing buyer confidence**: Perhaps the most striking trend? Comments like “So glad I picked this” and “Made the right choice” were common. People weren’t just reviewing a tool, they were justifying their decision. That’s the language of brand trust in action.

🔍 **Wider Market Context**  
Recent reviews from Tom's Guide and TechRadar suggest Shark's FlexStyle is rapidly closing the gap in the premium hair tool market. While Dyson still leads in brand recognition, its latest Airwrap i.d. drew criticism for adding unnecessary smart features that may complicate rather than enhance the user experience (*When ‘Smart’ Becomes Too Much*). 

In contrast, TechRadar positions the FlexStyle as one of 2025’s best all-in-one stylers, a strong performer with versatile attachments at a more accessible price point (*Top Hair Stylers of 2025*). Dyson may have the name, but Shark increasingly has the edge.

Why is it gaining traction? Because it blends professional results with practical ease. It doesn’t feel like a salon tool, it feels like freedom: simple, powerful, and sensibly priced.

🧠 **Why This Matters**  
In our work decoding customer language, patterns like these don’t just reflect taste, they forecast direction.

Dyson isn’t losing ground because of features alone. It’s losing emotional momentum. Users are signalling subtle dissatisfaction, not just with performance, but with expectation mismatch.

Shark, by contrast, is benefiting from a linguistic halo. The words people use signal satisfaction, surprise, and value. In other words, it’s not just competing, it’s connecting.

Language reflects perception.  
Perception drives behaviour.  
And behaviour drives sales.

At Capodan, we decode the language customers use, and what it really means for your product, positioning, and performance.
